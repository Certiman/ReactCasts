ReactCasts - todo
=================

This git changes some minor aspects on @StephenGrider 's ReactCast - todos example:

1. When pressing Enter in the textbox, nothing happened. I added event handlers to catch those, in Header and ListItem.

2. Restyling the app as a webapp.

3. Hide the "Clear Completed" button, when there are no Todo's.
