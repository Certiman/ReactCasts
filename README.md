ReactCasts - todo
=================

This git changes some minor aspects on @StephenGrider 's ReactCast - todos example:

1. (DONE) When pressing Enter in the textbox, nothing happened. I added event handlers to catch those, in Header and ListItem.

2. (DONE) Restyling the app as a webapp.

3. (Seems to require Flux) Hide the "Clear Completed" button, when there are no Todo's. 

4. (DONE, but rerendering fails) Foresee a "check All" button, that checks all items as done.
